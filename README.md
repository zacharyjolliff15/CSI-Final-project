# MySQL Slow Log Monitor (Windows Only)

This project automatically detects "slow" logs from your MySQL server and outputs the query that caused the delay to a basic ChatGPT wrapper in `index.html`.

---

## Pre-requirements

- **Python Version:**  
  Use Python **3.13.2 64-bit for Windows**.

- **Required Python Packages:**  
  Open a command prompt and run:
  ```bash
  py -3 -m pip install --upgrade openai
  py -3 -m pip install --upgrade watchdog

-  **MySQL Slow Log File Read Access:** 

    Navigate to:
```bash  
  C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data
  ```
Allow read access by selecting the folder and accepting the changes.

Configure MONITOR_FILE:

Change the MONITOR_FILE variable in your script to match your specific computer name. For example:

Example 1:
```bash  
MONITOR_FILE = r'C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data\DESKTOP-BDLUB0E-slow.log'
```
Example 2:
```bash  

MONITOR_FILE = r'C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data\DESKTOP-SH1LFM2-slow.log'
```

**Setting Up Read Permissions for the Slow Log File**

*Locate the Slow Log File:*

Go to your *DESKTOP-[computerName]-slow.log* file (or *mysql.slow_log.csv* if that's the file you're using).

Next, Open File Properties:

Right-click the file and select Properties.

Navigate to the Security tab.

Edit Permissions:

Click the Edit… button.

If your user account is not listed, add it by clicking Add…, then type your username or use Advanced… >

Click Apply and OK to save the changes.

Confirm any User Account Control (UAC) prompts if not running as an administrator.

**What It Does**

Detection:
Automatically detects slow logs generated by the MySQL server.
Outputs the query that caused the slow log to a basic ChatGPT wrapper displayed in index.html.

***Set-Up for the Application***

Install MySQL Server Workbench (and SQL Server):

Install MySQL Server Workbench.

Install SQL Server

Start the MySQL Server:

Open MySQL Workbench.

Create a new connection.

Start the server from Workbench.

Create the Database:

Use the database-test-schema.txt file.

Copy and paste the SQL query from the file into SQL Server to create the database.

**Launching the Application:**

Navigate to the folder containing app.py.

Run:
```py app.py```

**Test the Application:**

In SQL Server, run a query that takes longer than 10 seconds to execute (e.g., SELECT SLEEP(25);) to trigger a slow log.
